The notification system keeps you updated on new features, updates, and announcements.

1.  **Opening Notifications:** Click the bell icon in the top navigation bar to open the notification modal. A red dot on the bell indicates unread notifications.

3.  **Reading Notifications:** Click on a notification to expand it and read the full summary.
4.  **Marking as Read/Unread:** Click the "Mark as read" or "Mark as unread" button on a notification to toggle its read status. You can also mark all notifications as read by clicking the "Mark all as read" button.

### Managing Notifications

Notifications are stored in a Firebase collection named `notifications`. There is a single document in this collection with the ID `main`. This document contains an array field called `notifications` where all the notification objects are stored.

To add a new notification, you need to add a new object to this array. Here is the structure of a notification object:

```json
{
  "id": "a-unique-id",
  "type": "feature",
  "title": "New Feature: AI-Generated Headings",
  "summary": "The main heading on the page is now generated by AI!",
  "description": "The heading will change periodically to give you a fun, new greeting every time you visit.",
  "date": "2025-08-28",
  "unreadBy": []
}
```

**Fields:**

*   `id` (string): A unique identifier for the notification.
*   `type` (string): The type of notification. This determines the color of the dot. Can be `feature`, `update`, or `announcement`.
*   `title` (string): The title of the notification.
*   `summary` (string): A short summary that is always visible.
*   `description` (string): The full description, visible when the notification is expanded.
*   `date` (string): The date of the notification in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
*   `unreadBy` (array): An array of user IDs who have read the notification. This should be an empty array `[]` for new notifications.

### Adding New Emojis

To add a new emoji to the mood selector, follow these steps:

1.  **Add the Emoji Image:**
    *   Place your new emoji image (as a `.png` file) in the `public/moods` directory.
    *   Make sure the file name is in `kebab-case` (e.g., `new-emoji.png`).

2.  **Update the Moods List:**
    *   Open the `src/index.js` file.
    *   Find the `moods` array (around line 1420).
    *   Add a new object to the array for your new emoji, following this format:

    ```javascript
    { name: 'Your Emoji Name', image: 'your-emoji-file-name.png' }
    ```

    *   Replace `'Your Emoji Name'` with the desired display name and `'your-emoji-file-name.png'` with the actual file name of your emoji.
